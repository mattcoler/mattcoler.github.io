## Curriculum
The curriculum is aligned across four blocks. The first block is called **Background**. The courses in this block lay the foundations for the MSc. Voice Technology with essential content needed for the rest of the program, such as skills in programming and speech sounds analysis. The Introduction to Voice Technology course provides the basic elements of speech recognition and synthesis and introduces topics relating to data management, privacy issues and the interaction between humans and voice tech applications.

The second block offers **subject-specific courses** on voice technology. The knowledge and skills learned in the first block are used together with Machine Learning within the courses Speech Recogni=on I and Speech Synthesis I. Students learn step-by-step different approaches in building conventional speech recognition and text-to-speech systems.

The third block concerns **applications**. Speech recognition is taken to a higher level in Speech Recognition II as students learn about state-of-the art speech recognition systems and challenges within automatic speech recognition, e.g. background noises, accents, and multilingual speech. Likewise, the course Speech Synthesis II builds further on the knowledge and skills that were gained in the Speech Synthesis I course. The course on Thesis Design educates students on experiment design and research ethics. During this course students write a research proposal and perform a pilot study to prepare them for their thesis study.

In the fourth block, students combine knowledge and skills from the previous blocks and use them in their **Thesis Project**. During their thesis project students will conduct the study described in the research proposal wriKen in the Thesis Design course. They also build a demonstrator of a voice tech applica=on that relates to their thesis. Having a demonstrator alongside a master’s thesis enhances graduates’ competitive edge in the labor market.
